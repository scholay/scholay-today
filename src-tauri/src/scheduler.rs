//! The desktop refresh scheduler: a Tauri-aware wrapper around the UI-free
//! [`papr_core::ingestion::refresh::refresh_core`].
//!
//! `refresh_all` adds what only the desktop app needs — single-flight locking,
//! a progress channel to the webview, new-article notifications, FreshRSS sync
//! and tray/badge updates — while the actual fetch/parse/ingest pipeline lives
//! in `papr-core` so the agent CLI can drive the same code headlessly.
